<!-- 

In Javascript, we have total 6 types of functions:
> Named Function
> Anonymous Function
> Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
> Arrow Function
> Higher Order Function
> Recursive Function

> Named Function: 
    > A function with a name is called a named function.
    > It is the most common type of function.
    > It can be called using its name.
    > It can be used to perform a particular task.
    > It can be reused.
    > It is defined using the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

> Anonymous Function:
    > A function without a name is called an anonymous function.
    > It is also called a function expression.
    > It is defined using the function keyword, followed by parentheses ().

> Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):
    > A function that is executed immediately after it is created is called an IIFE.
    > It is also called a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.
    > It is defined using the function keyword, followed by parentheses (), followed by parentheses ().

> Arrow Function:
    > A function that uses the arrow (=>) notation to define a function is called an arrow function.
    > It is also called a fat arrow function.
    > It is defined using the arrow (=>) notation.

> IIFE:
    > A function that is executed immediately after it is created is called an IIFE.
    > It is also called a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.
    > It is defined using the function keyword, followed by parentheses ().

> Higher Order Function:
    > A function that takes another function as an argument or returns another function as a result is called a higher order function.
    > It is also called a callback function.
    > It is defined using the function keyword, followed by parentheses (), followed by curly braces {}.

> Recursive Function:
    > A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.
    > It is defined using the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (), followed by curly braces {}.
