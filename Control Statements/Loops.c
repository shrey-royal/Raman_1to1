/*
Loops: used to run same code multiple times

3 types of loops:
> entry controlled loops: condition will be checked while entering the loop
    1. for loop: used when there are fixed iterations
    2. while loop: used when there are not any fixed iterations
> exit controlled loops: condition will ve checked while exiting the loop
    1. do while loop: when we want that the body gets executed at least once
